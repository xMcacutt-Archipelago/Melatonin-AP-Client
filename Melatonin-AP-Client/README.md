## Implementation Details

Partially because it was funny, but also because it keeps the clean game aesthetic, there is only one item in this implementation.

### ★ The Star ★

Based on your settings, some number of stars will be added to the multiworld item pool.
Each level will be locked behind a star count. All four levels in a night must be completed before the remix for the night is unlocked.
Upon achieving 2★ or higher on the remix, the next night will unlock.
